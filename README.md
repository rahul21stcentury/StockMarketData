My personal Script to do Statistical Analysis on Stocks(More than 1400 stocks)


Analyse.ipynb Analyses All stocks in NSE and gives you a data with mean and standard deviation in excel file, higher the std more volatile a stock is and mean helps you determine by how much a stock varies on average each day. You can choose among these the safe stocks , then you can compare among them what to buy.
Also you can do a analysis on your own on individual stocks in Analyse.ipynb,You have choice either do all codes avaiable which take minutes or individual
.However due to technical reasons,some stocks may not be analysed.If it gives a Error it may be because of connection, retry again.
